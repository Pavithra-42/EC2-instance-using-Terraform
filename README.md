Project using Terraform to automate cloud infrastructure on AWS! ðŸš€


Key Functionalities:

ðŸ”‘ VPC Setup: Automated the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with associated subnets for secure network segmentation.

ðŸ”‘ EC2 Instance Launch: Provisioned an EC2 instance within the VPC.

ðŸ”‘ Private Key Generation: Automated the generation and downloading of a private key for secure access to the EC2 instance.

ðŸ”‘ Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managed all configurations in a single main.tf file to ensure consistency and easy scalability.


Key Steps:

terraform init: Initializes the working directory, downloads the necessary provider plugins, and prepares the environment for execution.

terraform plan: Simulates the execution plan to visualize what changes will be made without actually deploying them.

terraform apply: Executes the plan, creating the VPC, subnets, and EC2 instance, and downloading the private key for secure login.


Key Factors:

Scalability: The infrastructure is defined entirely through Terraform, making it easy to scale up or down by modifying the configurations.

Reproducibility: Using the terraform init, plan, and apply commands ensures that infrastructure can be recreated in any environment, ensuring consistency.

Security: With the private key generated and securely downloaded, access to the EC2 instance is tightly controlled.


Project Use:

This project is ideal for anyone looking to automate cloud infrastructure with Terraform. By managing VPC, EC2 instances, and secure logins, it can serve as a foundation for larger cloud architectures, CI/CD pipelines, or microservices setups.
